# OOTD - Outfit Of The Day

Instant food delivery? Done. Instant grocery delivery? Done. Instant clothe delivery? No more 6-7 business days. Let's make it happen now. Choose your instant pick from "OOTD-Outfit Of The Day".

## Introduction
OOTD is a revolutionary concept that brings the convenience of instant delivery to the world of fashion. Just like popular food delivery apps like Swiggy and Zomato, OOTD allows you to browse through a wide selection of outfits from your favorite shopping brands near your locality and have them delivered to your doorstep instantly.
Gone are the days of waiting 6-7 business days for your online orders to arrive. With OOTD, you can shop for the perfect outfit for any occasion and have it delivered to you in no time. Whether you need a last-minute outfit for a party, a casual look for a day out, or professional attire for work, OOTD has you covered.
Our platform connects you with nearby outlets of popular shopping brands, ensuring that you have access to the latest trends and styles. With just a few clicks, you can browse through a curated selection of outfits, choose your size and quantity, and have your order delivered straight to your doorstep.

Say goodbye to long shipping times and hello to instant fashion with OOTD. Experience the convenience of shopping for clothes online like never before.

## How it Works

The concept revolves around the same principles as food delivery apps. Users can browse available picks from the nearest regional outlet of their favorite shopping brands, such as Westside, Trends, Max, and more. They can view the dresses, choose their size and quantity, make a selection, and add their address for the dress to be delivered.
The delivery process is managed by collaborating with existing delivery partners of enterprises like Swiggy, Blinkit, BlueDart, ensuring reliable and speedy delivery of the chosen outfits.

## Tools

- **Frontend:** React
- **Backend:** Django


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
